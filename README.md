This is the coding compnents to my arduino game that copies Simon Say's memory game. I made it so there are four buttons that correspond to four LED lights, and that when you press the button corresponding to the blue led light, the game begins. For a natural beginning, I made it so the very first LED to light up is always blue, but after that it becomes random. If you have an amazing memory and can get to 50, you win!
